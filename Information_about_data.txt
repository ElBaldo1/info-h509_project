the station is mapped with a single node with 
	railway=station or 
	railway=halt (for the smaller ones)


the station area can be mapped with a way encompassing the buildings, 
	railway platforms tagged with public_transport=station
the station should be also mapped with a relation public_transport=stop_area 
	which gathers all objects of the station (platforms, stops, …)

The railway platforms are the places where you actually take the train or step down from it. They are mapped with a way and tagged simply 	with railway=platform. 
	A very important tag to add is the ref=*, which is the numbers of the platforms. 
	The ref is always one or two numbers, that need to be separated by a semicolon “;”, e.g., ref=2;3.

A platform gives access to one or two tracks, 
	 first track (ref=1) only gives access to this first track
	the others platforms (2;3, 4;5, …) give access to 2 tracks.

Conveying ramps, aka escalators are represented as a way and tagged with highway=steps + conveying=*. 
	The query https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1pm4 gives 198 conveying objects around the Belgian train platforms (within a distance of 10 m).
	Steps are represented as a way and tagged with highway=steps.
